			        <div class="panel-body">There are many ways to promote your music and new venues open new opportunities to live your passion. Make sure you are up to date with the latest trends and events in the music industry. To start we recommend you put your music on major platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, Audiomack, SoundCloud, and YouTube. And then you can decide which platform you want to boost your streams/plays.</div>

			        </h4>
			      </div>
			      <div id="collapse2" class="panel-collapse collapse">
			        <div class="panel-body">The best music promotion campaign takes everything into consideration. If your manager or publicist is only focused on one platform, it can backfire. If all your energy is focused on developing a strong Twitter presence, and your account gets suspended for some reason, it will be a huge blow to your career, and you would have invested a lot of time and energy into a platform that you can no longer utilize.
					<br />
					YoFamous knows that it’s not just about the music or your image – it’s about all of it coming together to form a brand. Your music promotion campaign should include dropping loose songs on all digital music streaming platforms when you are trying to promote a new project, or short clips of you in the studio making some new songs on your social media platforms. It should also include Youtube uploads where you do Q and As with your fans, so that they know more about you.
					<br /> <br />
					The best music promotion campaign is an extensive one, that includes uploading photos and clips to social media, songs to Soundcloud and Audiomack, and strategies to also increase your Apple Music and Spotify Music, and followers. It’s about connecting with curators, landing on playlists, and boosting views. Thanks to YoFamous, you don’t have to spend thousands of dollars to make your music promotion campaign effective.
					<br /> <br />
					The best music promotion campaign also takes your personality into consideration. There might be some artists that love vlogging, while other artists might not like sitting in front of a camera and speaking to fans. Other artists might care more about showing footage of their tour or live performances more than anything else, and it might drive fans to see you on tour next time. It doesn’t matter whether you want to showcase your humor, personality, significant other, bandmates, or curator skills – a music promotion campaign takes your personality and image into consideration.</div>

			        <h4 class="panel-title">
			          <a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapse3">What music promotion packages do you offer?</a>
			        </h4>
			      </div>
			      <div id="collapse3" class="panel-collapse collapse">
			        <div class="panel-body">Many music promotion packages only focus on one aspect of promotion, and we believe that’s why YoFamous is so different. Our paid music promotion packages can not only give you more views; after all, there are thousands of companies that are selling fake bot views, and some customers end up disappointed when they realize that it wasn’t worth the money. We don’t just offer more views for music promotion packages, we also offer much more:
					<br /> <br />
					Our paid music promotion packages are also about curation. The right playlist can truly make a real difference, and many music industry insiders believe that playlists are one of the most important aspects of a career right now. If your song is good and ends up on a playlist with multi-platinum artists, then that means that you could potentially gain fans and followership from them.
					<br /> <br />
					The music promotion packages we offer might help you get more views and engagements on all social media platforms, which can help companies reach out to you for endorsement deals. Our music promotion packages will also help you connect with more undiscovered artists and producers, and connect you to fans that are focused on new music.
					 <br /> <br />
					Every artist should understand their goals and expectations from their music promotion packages, and figure out what platform makes the most sense for them. If your “image” isn’t as important as your music to you – you might focus on Spotify, Apple, Soundcloud, and Audiomack. However, you might have invested all of your resources into an upcoming music video. In this case, it might be better to purchase music promotion packages related to your Youtube channel.
					<br /> <br />
					YoFamous offers incredible value for our paid music promotion packages, and we are known for our quick delivery and turnaround!</div>

			        </h4>
			      </div>
			      <div id="collapse4" class="panel-collapse collapse in">
			        <div class="panel-body">YoFamous has a lot of different packages to offer, and artists will have to figure out the option that suits their needs. If you can afford to invest $100 in your music career without thinking twice about it, you might want to consider purchasing some of the more advanced music promotion packages. Of course, the best music promo is the promotion on the platform that you already understand.
			        	<br /><br />

					Some artists showcase their image the best on Instagram, while others might look to Soundcloud promotion or Audiomack promotion as a way to promote some underrated tracks. The best music promo package is the package that will lead to the most followers and fans. If you can, you might want to consider purchasing several packages and then figuring out what to target from there.
					<br /><br />

					The best music promo strategy is a strategy that incorporates as many different social media platforms as possible. If you are an artist or a content creator that doesn’t have the time to upload content, in addition to purchasing the best music promo you can, you may consider hiring a social media manager in the future. Of course, if you are trying to promote a podcast – it might be best to target platforms like Spotify and/or Audiomack rather than Youtube (since the visual aspect might be less important, or even nonexistent).
					<br /><br />

					The best music promo is a consistent music promotion, and you should allocate some of your funds to making sure that your content is properly promoted. Artists should also take the time to pay attention to all the details of marketing, whether it has to do with your bio, your Instagram caption, or responding to fans on Twitter. You may want to figure out your budget before deciding the best music promo that YoFamous has to offer. Either way, you can count on us to make sure that results are delivered promptly.</div>

			        </h4>
			      </div>
			      <div id="collapse4" class="panel-collapse collapse in">
			        <div class="panel-body">There are several music marketing companies out there, but YoFamous is definitely one of the best music marketing companies out there. We are extremely affordable, which is great for artists all over the world that are working very hard to build a following. While some of the other best music marketing companies are overcharging artists for publicity, we make it clear that there are different packages that cater to artists with specific budgets.
			        	<br /> <br />

					We also deliver on time, so you’ll never be waiting and wondering about your results. We believe that the best music marketing companies are the ones that actually deliver instead of having artists wait around for weeks, wondering what they did with their money. We also have free promotions regularly, because we are proud of the fact that we truly back up our claims.
					<br /> <br />

					The best music marketing companies are ones that are transparent about their success and have an established track record. If you have a team, you may want to ask them their thoughts about the best music marketing companies to consider, and figure out the right budget to allocate for your own marketing needs. Of course, it’s also important to deal with a company that stays on top of trends. If you are dealing with one of the best music marketing companies, but they don’t truly understand the modern music industry – this could prove to be a mistake. Ultimately, your music marketing company should be able to be reached at all times and open to your feedback/suggestions.
					<br /> <br />

					YoFamous isn’t here to overcharge for our services, but offer a way for independent musicians to promote themselves without spending outrageous amounts of money. We do believe that we are one of the best music marketing companies in the world, which is one of the reasons that we offer free promotion deals to prove to our clients that we care about their success</div>

			        <div class="panel-body">Any artist is faced with the challenge of promoting their music and reaching their audience. While your main focus should remain to produce great music for people to enjoy, you must also use all the tools available in the online environment. It has never been so easy and cost-effective as now to have your music heard by millions of fans worldwide. You can upload your music on SoundCloud, or upload videos on Youtube and use Facebook’s powerful tools to promote your work. In this sense, you will be more like a mini record label. This will give you the opportunity and also the responsibility of managing and creating your own team and environment to build a strong fan base.</div>

			      <div id="collapse6" class="panel-collapse collapse in">
			        <div class="panel-body">Some artists become wary about the concept of a music promotion service because they are not sure if they will get real results, but YoFamous is here to help. We do provide real views and followers for organic reach, and these fans are truly interested in what you have to offer. While other services might rely on bots and click-farms, we deliver real results for affordable rates.
			        	<br /> <br />

					YoFamous also delivers real results quickly. This is our true advantage because some of our competitors take their sweet time once they get paid by artists. If you work with us, you won’t be sitting around for days, or even weeks, wondering when your music will start being promoted. We do deliver the fans and followers, but it’s up to artists to keep that momentum going. In addition to using a music promotion service, artists should also focus on recording and live shows at the same time.

					No music promotion service can guarantee success, but we do offer the opportunity for more visibility and exposure. Of course, if you end up landing on certain playlists – this could lead to many more opportunities, and there’s a good chance that music blogs will be reaching out to you and that more artists want to collaborate with you. The right music promotion service also understands what you are trying to accomplish, and delivers results on time. YoFamous can absolutely help you with your music promotion service needs, no matter the size of your audience or fanbase.
					<br /> <br />

					We believe in giving artists the power to take their careers in their own hands, rather than waiting on a record label to finally supply them with a budget. The Internet is now capable of actually breaking an artist that might not otherwise have the resources, and that’s why our music promotion service might be integral to your long-term success.</div>

			      <div id="collapse7" class="panel-collapse collapse in">
			        <div class="panel-body">There are many music marketing companies that only focus on one aspect of music promotion services, but can’t deliver when it comes to other aspects. YoFamous knows that there are all sorts of ways to promote yourself, which is why we do it all! Here is some information regarding the music promotion service that we offer.
			        	<br /> <br />

					We offer music promotion services that help you get more VIEWS. This is great for the Youtube algorithm, and it could mean that your video ends up being recommended way more than usual. Many artists have been able to put together a creative music video that ends up going viral, and our package could potentially make that happen for you.
					<br /> <br />

					We also offer music promotion services that get your more FOLLOWERS. You will find that the music industry respects numbers, and more followers, in their eyes, means more fans or potential fans. This adds more credibility and leverage to artists hoping to make lucrative deals, and we are happy to provide this service for an affordable price.
					<br /> <br />

					We also offer a music promotion service that can land you on PLAYLISTS. The music industry can be an insular world, and it can be hard to reach the curators that really dictate music industry trends. However, YoFamous might just be able to help you land on that powerful playlist that can bring new eyes to your music, and it might be the difference between remaining unknown and finally creating a buzz.
					<br /> <br />

					Some of these music promotion services might make sense for specific artists more than others. For example, your followers might be growing organically, but you might want to reach out to us for playlist submission. Similarly, you might be fine with landing on playlists already but want to make sure that your music video gets more views so that it is recommended more. Either way, YoFamous has something to offer that can help give you the promotional “boost” you need!</div>

			        </h4>
			      </div>
			      <div id="collapse8" class="panel-collapse collapse in">
			        <div class="panel-body">There are many artists that don’t have the same time and/or resources as those backed by a major record label. As a result, they are always searching for smart cheap music promotion tactics. YoFamous is proud to offer music promotion at affordable rates, whether all you have is $10 or $100 to promote your music. We recognize that not every artist has thousands of dollars to pour into their career every month, and we hope that you take advantage of our offers.

			        	<br /> <br />

					Of course, one smart cheap music promotion strategy is to make sure that your fans become your biggest advocates. One way that you can do this is to ask them to spread the word about your shows and/or projects, and you can even hold sweepstakes to offer them merchandise for being your cheap music promotion advocates. You can also hold contests by asking fans to retweet or post content of yours, and state that the winner will get to meet you, or get a phone call from you. It’s also important to define “cheap” – for some, cheap music promotion is a $100 strategy, while for some it’s a $10 strategy. If you can’t afford $10 for a cheap music promotion package, you may want to work on saving your money up first before thinking about cheap music promotion.
					<br /> <br />

					Ultimately, a digital marketing strategy is essential for modern music artists to succeed. First, you should figure out the kind of platform that you want to target the most and come up with ideas regarding what strategies will work the best. Afterward, choose the YoFamous cheap music promotion package that makes the most sense for you. Your fans can also help you make decisions regarding your cheap music promotion strategy, and what works best for your brand and/or image.</div>

			      <div id="collapse9" class="panel-collapse collapse in">
			        <div class="panel-body">There are many artists that KNOW that they want to promote their music, but they aren’t sure about the best way to do it. The first thing that artists should do is examine their strengths and weaknesses. If you are known for your live performances, maybe the best idea is to upload a recent live performance where a lot of your fans loved the performance. If you are known for your music videos, then why not purchase a YoFamous that can help you get more Youtube views. If you promote in an area where you are already succeeding, there’s a good chance that the strategy will work even more.
			        	<br /> <br />

					If you are in a band or a collective of some kind – it can be difficult to have conversations about how to promote your music. You may even want to consider making a list of pros and cons to figure out the best steps to take or consult with music industry professionals that can offer you some guidance. You should also figure out a budget that works for you, and whether this promotion will be consistent or a one-time purchase.
					<br /> <br />

					Some artists think that how to promote your music is simply to buy as many views as possible, while other artists are only focused on playlist promotion. You should do some research regarding how artists in your genre have gotten discovered because that can help you understand which way the industry is trending.
					<br /> <br />

					No one 100% understands the foolproof strategy regarding how to promote your music, because some artists get famous on Tiktok and others get famous on Soundcloud. However, if you are constantly analyzing and researching your own fanbase: you may just get some answers about how to promote your music. If you can figure out what NOT to do – it can help you get a clearer picture of the way to promote your music moving forward.</div>

			        <div class="panel-body">Definitely yes! You should promote Your Music on Social Media Platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. This is an essential part of your success these days. Whether you’re sharing your blog posts, your website, your music or even your music videos, it’s essential that you have some form of social media presence. Some of the best include Facebook and Instagram, but you may want to consider platforms like Snapchat and Twitter. This will probably be the most popular way for you to connect with your audience and fans and industry peers. We can boost your posts with likes, views, comments and impressions to attract other people to tag along.</div>

			        </h4>
			      </div>
			      <div id="collapse11" class="panel-collapse collapse in">
			        <div class="panel-body">There are many bands, musicians, and artists that focus on channeling their creativity into their music. While there’s nothing wrong with this, the problem is that many artists aren’t thinking about the “business” side of the music business. If you are an artist that is serious about your career ambitions, you must realize that more fans have to know about you for your audience to grow. There’s nothing wrong with consistent live shows, but a strong digital marketing strategy goes a long way.
			        	<br /> <br />

					This is one of the reasons why a music promotion agency is so important. They can offer some guidance regarding what platforms you should target, and a boost in views and likes can add more credibility to you as an artist. While it might sound superficial to some artists, it might mean the difference between getting that placement, collaboration, endorsement, or not. At the end of the day, a music promotion agency can help define your fan demographics, which can be used for all aspects of your career.
					<br /> <br />

					A music promotion agency can also help you network when it comes to other peers, as well. They might be able to help you make connections with artists with larger audiences, which means that you are more likely to land on influential playlists. While one collaboration might not change your life, it can give you an immense amount of credibility in the music industry. For these reasons and more, a music promotion company is extremely important.
					<br /> <br />

					Of course, it’s important to find a music promotion agency that understands the way that you want to approach the industry. If they don’t truly understand your brand messaging, there’s a good chance that the relationship won’t work. YoFamous can help you promote yourself properly, and we take the time to truly deliver results.</div>

			        </h4>
			      </div>
			      <div id="collapse12" class="panel-collapse collapse in">
			        <div class="panel-body">There are all sorts of music marketing companies out there, and there’s a reason that they are needed. Let’s say that you are an artist that is extremely talented, but isn’t known outside of your city. The right music marketing company can make sure that you get on certain blogs and playlists that can help you raise your profile, and it might even bring you national attention. If you become well-known, there might even be artists reaching out to compliment you on your successor for a potential collaboration.
			        	<br /> <br />

					Music marketing can also make sure that your fans feel like they are connected. Let’s say that you are an artist with 100,000 fans, but are trying to reach a million. You might not have time to engage with your fans, but a music marketing company can take care of that for you. This will help your fans feel more strongly about you, and social media engagement can lead to more followers and fans than ever before.
					<br /> <br />

					It doesn’t matter how incredible your project is – it won’t be bringing in consistent revenue until the music is known by everybody. In this way, a music marketing agency can also help you get placements in TV shows and commercials, which leads to an entirely new audience. If you aren’t serious about music marketing, you might find that your career stalls out – because your existing fans might support you, but new fans don’t know about you or your music.
					<br /> <br />

					Some artists view music marketing differently. Music marketing is about more than one thing – it isn’t just about social media marketing, landing or blogs, or getting interviewed by music influencers. Music marketing is essential for any artist that is serious about their brand and their talent. If you are serious about music marketing, it could potentially mean that your brand is relevant for years, or even decades.</div>
